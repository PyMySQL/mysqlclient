0.9.1c2 

  * Exceptions on connect() were not handled correctly.

  * Added CHANGELOG to MANIFEST.in. (John Bowe)

0.9.1c1

  * Added ER_PARSE_ERROR as a ProgrammingError, because
    ER_SYNTAX_ERROR doesn't get the job done.

  * In Python < 2.0.1, PyArgs_ParseTupleAndKeywords() returns a new
    reference when the O format is used. In 2.0.1 and later, it
    returns a borrowed reference. Since it's not actually documented
    either way that I can tell, I must assume this is some sort of
    bugfix. However, it does mean that you need to test against the
    Python version, and Py_INCREF() if it is 2.0.1 or later. If you
    Py_INCREF() all the time, you get a memory leak in earlier
    version; and if you never Py_INCREF(), it works fine in earlier
    versions but crashes later versions. If you're an end-user, don't
    worry about this...

  * In Python 2.2, the internal _PyTuple_Resize() dropped the (unused)
    third argument, so we have to test against the Python version here
    as well to maintain backwards compatibility.

  * Some deprecated MySQL API functions were removed.

  * A literal() method was added to the database connection. It takes
    a single argument and converts it into an SQL literal. If the
    argument is a non-string sequence, the sequence items are
    converted to SQL literals, and the sequence of converted items is
    returned as a list. This was previously done internally by Cursor
    objects. You don't normally need to use it, but it might be useful
    for debugging.

  * Return DECIMAL/NUMERIC columns as floats.

  * A number of documentation updates.


0.9.0

  Too many changes from 0.3.5 to go into much detail.

  * MySQLdb was turned into a true Python package.

  * _mysql didn't change all that much. Constants were moved out into
    the MySQLdb package structure. Exceptions were moved to
    _mysql_exceptions.py, but these are imported into _mysql. This
    makes the binary (and source) significantly smaller.

  * Reduced threadsafety to 1 (from 2), and ripped out a lot of the
    crap that attempts to let you safely share a connection between
    threads. If you are using transactions, you can only hand off the
    connection from one thread to another after a commit or
    rollback. Sharing a connection will hurt your performance anyway,
    so give each thread it's own connection.

  * A Set class was added for use with SET columns.

  * Loads of docstrings were added to take advantage of pydoc.

  * Operationally, there's not much difference.
