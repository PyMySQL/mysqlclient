====================
MySQLdb Installation
====================



Prerequisites
-------------

+ Python 2.3.4 or higher

  * http://www.python.org/

  * Versions lower than 2.2 WON'T WORK.

  * 2.2.x MIGHT work, or have partial functionality.

  * 2.4 is tested and works.

  * Red Hat Linux:

    - Make sure you have the Python development headers and libraries
      (python-devel).

+ MySQL 3.23.32 or higher

  * http://www.mysql.com/downloads/

  * Versions lower than 3.22 definitely WON'T WORK.

  * Versions lower than 3.22.19 might not work.

  * MySQL-3.22 is deprecated in favor of 3.23, but still supported.

  * MySQL-3.23 is supported, but slightly deprecated.

  * MySQL-4.0 is supported.

  * MySQL-4.1 is mostly supported; the new prepared statements API
    is not yet supported, and probably won't be until MySQLdb-1.3 or
    2.0.

  * MySQL-5.0 and newer are not currently supported, but might work.
      
  * MaxDB, formerly known as SAP DB (and maybe Adabas D?), is a
    completely different animal. Use the sapdb.sql module that comes
    with MaxDB.

  * Red Hat Linux packages:

    - mysql-devel to compile

    - mysql and/or mysql-devel to run

  * MySQL.com RPM packages:

    - MySQL-devel to compile

    - MySQL-shared if you want to use their shared
      library. Otherwise you'll get a statically-linked module,
      which may or may not be what you want.

    - MySQL-shared to run if you compiled with MySQL-shared installed

  * Transactions (particularly InnoDB tables) are supported for
    MySQL-3.23 and up. You may need a special package from your vendor
    with this support turned on. If you have Gentoo Linux, set either
    of the berkdb or innodb USE flags on your server, and comment out
    "skip-innodb" in /etc/mysql/my.cnf for InnoDB table support.
      

+  zlib

   * Required for MySQL-3.23 and newer.

   * Red Hat Linux

     - zlib-devel to compile

     - zlib to run

+ openssl

  * May be needed for MySQL-4.0 or newer, depending on compilation
    options.

+ C compiler

  * Most free software-based systems already have this, usually gcc.

  * Most commercial UNIX platforms also come with a C compiler, or
    you can also use gcc.

  * If you have some Windows flavor, you usually have to pay extra
    for this, or you can use Cygwin_.

Building and installing
-----------------------

The setup.py script uses mysql_config to find all compiler and linker
options, and should work as is on any POSIX-like platform, so long as
mysql_config is in your path.

Depending on which version of MySQL you have, you may have the option
of using three different client libraries:

mysqlclient
	 mostly but not guaranteed thread-safe

mysqlclient_r
	thread-safe, use if you can

mysqld
	embedded server

mysqlclient_r is used by default. To use one of the others, set
the environment variable mysqlclient to the name of the library
you want to use. In a Bourne-style shell, use::

    $ export mysqlclient=mysqlclient

Only do this if you don't have the thread-safe library (mysqlclient_r)
or you want to use the embedded server (mysqld).

Finally, putting it together::

  $ tar xfz MySQL-python-1.2.0.tar.gz
  $ cd MySQL-python-1.2.0
  $ python setup.py build
  $ su # or use sudo
  # python setup.py install

NOTE: You must export environment variables for setup.py to see them.
Depending on what shell you prefer, you may need to use "export" or
"set -x" (bash and other Bourne-like shells) or "setenv" (csh-like
shells).
  
Windows
.......

I don't do Windows. However if someone provides me with a package for
Windows, I'll make it available. Don't ask me for help with Windows
because I can't help you.

Generally, though, running setup.py is similar to above::

  C:\...> python setup.py install
  C:\...> python setup.py bdist_wininst

The latter example should build a Windows installer package, if you
have the correct tools. In any event, you *must* have a C compiler.
Additionally, you have to set an environment variable (mysqlroot)
which is the path to your MySQL installation. In theory, it would be
possible to get this information out of the registry, but like I said,
I don't do Windows, but I'll accept a patch that does this.

Zope
....

If you are using a binary package of Zope, you need run setup.py with
the python executable that came with Zope. Otherwise, you'll install
into the wrong Python tree and Zope (ZMySQLDA) will not be able to
find _mysql.

With zope.org's Zope-2.5.1-linux2-x86 binary tarball, you'd do
something like this::

    $ export ZOPEBIN=".../Zope-2.5.1-linux2-x86/bin" # wherever you unpacked it
    $ $ZOPEBIN/python setup.py install # builds and installs


Binary Packages
---------------

I don't plan to make binary packages any more. However, if someone
contributes one, I will make it available. Several OS vendors have
their own packages available.


RPMs
....
    
If you prefer to install RPMs, you can use the bdist_rpm command with
setup.py. This only builds the RPM; it does not install it. You may
want to use the --python=XXX option, where XXX is the name of the
Python executable, i.e. python, python2, python2.1; the default is
python. Using this will incorporate the Python executable name into
the package name for the RPM so you have install the package multiple
times if you need to support more than one version of Python.


Red Hat Linux
.............

MySQL-python is pre-packaged in Red Hat Linux 7.x and newer. This
likely includes Fedora Core and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can also
build your own RPM packages as described above.


Debian GNU/Linux
................

Packaged as `python-mysqldb`_::

	# apt-get install python-mysqldb

.. _`python-mysqldb`: http://packages.debian.org/python-mysqldb


Gentoo Linux
............

Packaged as `mysql-python`_. Gentoo is also my development platform::

      # emerge sync
      # emerge mysql-python
      # emerge zmysqlda # if you use Zope

.. _`mysql-python`: http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=mysql-python


BSD
...

MySQL-python is a ported package in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD,
although the name may vary to match OS conventions.
